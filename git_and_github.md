# Navigating a commit history
## Find the difference using Mac
```
diff -u old_game.js new_game.js
```
`-u`: unified diff format, making the output easier to read

## View history using Git
```
git log
```
Shows id number, author, date, and commit message

## Find difference using Git
```
git diff <id_number_1> <id_number_2>
```

## Statistics of which files have changed in each commit
```
git log --stat
```
Shows ++++-- across multiple files <br>
Press `q` to exit git log

## Clone Git repository
```
git clone <url>
```

## Getting Colored Output
To get colored `diff` output, run <br>
```
git config --global color.ui auto
```

## Checkout an old version
```
git checkout <id_number>
```

<br>

# Creating and modifying a repository
## Show hidden files
```
ls -a
```

## Initialize a new git repository, there is no commit yet
```
git init
```

## Show which file has been changed since last commit
```
git status
```

## Add files to the staging area, aka., changes to be committed
```
git add filename.txt
```

## Remove a file from staging area
```
git reset filename.txt
```

## Commit changes and write commit message
```
git commit
```
Or
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Commit message style guide: http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

## Show any changes in the working directory that have not been added to the staging area yet
```
git diff
```

## Show changes in the staging area that have not been committed yet
```
git diff --staged
```

## Discard any change from both the working directory and the staging area
```
git reset --hard
```

## Branches are helpful 
* e.g. production quality vs development
* e.g. unique feature
* e.g. experimental work

## Show the current branch
```
git branch
```

## Create a new branch
```
git branch new_branch_name
```

## Checkout the new branch
```
git checkout new_branch_name
```
## Or create and checkout in one command
```
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

## See the visual representation of the commit history 
```
git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2
```

## Delete previous branch
```
git branch -d branch_name
```

If a branch is deleted and leaves some commits unreachable from existing branches, 
those commits will continue to be accessible by commit id, until Gitâ€™s garbage collection runs. You can also run this process manually with `git gc`.

## Merge branch2 and branch3 into master branch
```
git checkout master
git merge branch2 branch3
```

## Show the difference added by 1 particular commit without knowing its parent
```
git show commit_id
```
