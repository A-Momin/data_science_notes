# Big data

According to IBM: "Every day, 2.5 billion gigabytes of high-velocity data are created in a variety of forms, such as social media posts, information gathered in sensors and medical devices, videos and transaction records"

## 1. What is big data

**Big Data** is a loosely defined term used to describe data sets so large and complex that they become awkward to work with using standard statistical software.

**Big data** is high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization.

Challenges with big data

- **Volume** (size of data): Needs a cheaper way to store data reliably and to read and process data efficiently.
- **Velocity** (speed at which data were generated and needs to be processed): Needs to store and process at fast speed.
- **Variety** (difference sources and formats): Unstructured data can be difficult to store and reconcile in traditional systems (SQL)
- **Veracity** (uncertainty)
