Creating and modifying a repository

Show hidden files
ls -a

Initialize a new git repository, there is no commit yet
git init

Branches are helpful 
e.g. production quality vs development
e.g. unique feature
e.g. experimental

Show the current branch
git branch

Create a new branch
git branch new_branch_name
Checkout the new branch
git checkout new_branch_name
Or do the two thing in one command
git checkout -b new_branch_name

See the visual representation of the commit history 
git log --graph --oneline branch1 branch2

If a branch is deleted and leaves some commits unreachable from existing branches, 
those commits will continue to be accessible by commit id, until Gitâ€™s garbage collection runs. 
This will happen automatically from time to time, unless you actively turn it off. 
You can also run this process manually with git gc.

Merge branch 2 and 3 into master branch
git checkout master
git merge branch2 branch3

Show the difference added by 1 particular commit without knowing its parent
git show commit_id

Delete previous branch
git branch -d branch_name
