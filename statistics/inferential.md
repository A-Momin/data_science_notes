## 1. Terminology and fundamentals

### 1.1. Terminology

* **Population:** the entire group of interest
* **Sample:** subset of the population
* **Parameter:** a number that describes the population, typically unknown
* **Statistic:** a number that is computed from a sample
* **Sampling variability:** the statistics of different samples of a population will differ somewhat
* Sample skewness + fundamental randomness
* **Sampling distribution** is the distribution of a statistic across an infinite number of samples

### 1.2. Central Limit Theorem

As long as adequately large samples and adequately large number of samples are used from a population, the distribution of the statistics of the samples will be normally distributed.

## 2. Hypothesis testing

**Hypothesis testing:** Assessing evidence provided by the data in favor of or against each hypothesis about the population.

1. Specify the null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_a$) hypothesis
2. Choose a sample
3. Assess the evidence
    * A result is **statistically significant** if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
    * Significance level of a test: $\alpha=0.05$
    * **p-value** is also called **type one error rate** = the probability we would be wrong in rejecting null hypothesis
    * Probability value **p-value < 0.05**: more than 95% likely that the association of interest would be present following repeated samples drawn from the population (aka., sampling distribution). <br>

4. Draw conclusions
   * If p-value < $\alpha$: the data provide significant evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
   * If p-value > $\alpha$: the data do not provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis; the data do not provide enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis.

### 2.1. Standard error of the mean - a measure of confidence

* SE = s/sqrt(n)
* s: standard deviation of sample
* n: sample size

    ```python
    from scipy.stats import sem
    plt.errorbar(x_axis, means, yerr = standard_errors, fmt='o')
    ```

    comparing error bars could infer whether samples were drawn from the same population

### 2.2. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

Examine differences in the mean response variable for each category of our explanatory variable. E.g. Are any of the treatments significantly different than the rest?

* Hypothesis

    $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4$ <br>
    $H_a$: not all the $\mu$ are equal

* ANOVA F test
  
    Are the differences among the sample means due to true differences among the population means or merely due to sampling variability?

    **F statistic:** $F=\frac{variation\ among\ sample\ means}{variation\ within\ groups}$

* Code

    * Explanatory variable with 2 levels

        ```python
        import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
        
        # using ols function for calculating the F-statistic and associated p value
        # C(...) indicates categorical variable
        # dataset has no missing values
        model1 = smf.ols(formula='NUMCIGMO_EST ~ C(MAJORDEPLIFE)', data=sub1)
        results1 = model1.fit()
        print (results1.summary())
        ```

        Alternative syntax

        ```python
        import scipy.stats as stats

        # Perform the ANOVA
        stats.f_oneway(group1, group2, group3, group4, group5)
        ```

    * Explanatory variable with >2 levels

        ```python
        model2 = smf.ols(formula='NUMCIGMO_EST ~ C(ETHRACE2A)', data=sub3).fit()
        print (model2.summary())
        ```

        A significant ANOVA does not tell which groups are different from the others

    * Post hoc test when explanatory variable has >2 levels

        Cannot compare each pair one-by-one due to the increase in the Type 1 error rate called the family-wise error rate, the error rate for the group of pair comparison.

        <img src="resources/family_wise_error.png" width=400>

        Use one of the post hoc tests that are designed to evaluate the difference between pairs of means while protecting against inflation of Type 1 errors:
        
        * Sidak
        * Holm T test
        * Fisher's Least Significant Difference Test
        * Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Test
        * Scheffe test
        * Newman-Keuls test
        * Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test
        * Duncan Multiple Range Test
        * Bonferroni Procedure
  
        ```python
        import statsmodels.stats.multicomp as multi
        mc1 = multi.MultiComparison(sub3['NUMCIGMO_EST'], sub3['ETHRACE2A'])
        res1 = mc1.tukeyhsd()
        print(res1.summary())
        ```

### 2.3. Chi-Square test of independence

Which of the 2 categorical variables plays the role of the explanatory variable and then calculating the conditional percentages separately.

Whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories.

* Hypothesis

    $H_0$:
    
    * There is no difference in the drunk driving rate between males and females.
    * There is no relationship between the 2 categorical variables - they are independent.
    * Proportion of male drunk drivers = proportion of female drunk drivers.
  
    $H_a$:
    
    * There is a difference in the drunk driving rate between males and females.
    * There is a relationship between the 2 categorical variables - they are not independent.
    * Proportion of male drunk drivers â‰  proportion of female drunk drivers.

* $\chi^2$ test of independence

    <img src="resources/chi_suqare_table.png" width=600>
    <img src="resources/chi_suqare_txt.png" width=400>

    The p-value of the $\chi^2$ test of independence is the probability of getting counts like those observed, assuming that the 2 variables are not related.

* Code

    * Chi Square test of independence

        Test

        ```python
        import scipy.stats
        import seaborn
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # contingency table of observed counts
        ct1=pandas.crosstab(sub2['TAB12MDX'], sub2['USFREQMO']) # response, explanatory
        print (ct1)

        # column percentages
        colsum=ct1.sum(axis=0)
        colpct=ct1/colsum
        print(colpct)

        # chi-square
        print ('chi-square value, p value, expected counts')
        cs1= scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(ct1)
        print (cs1)
        ```

        Visualize

        ```python
        # set variable types 
        sub2["USFREQMO"] = sub2["USFREQMO"].astype('category')
        
        # new code for setting variables to numeric:
        sub2['TAB12MDX'] = pandas.to_numeric(sub2['TAB12MDX'], errors='coerce')
        
        # graph percent with nicotine dependence within each smoking frequency group 
        seaborn.factorplot(x="USFREQMO", y="TAB12MDX", data=sub2, kind="bar", ci=None)
        plt.xlabel('Days smoked per month')
        plt.ylabel('Proportion Nicotine Dependent')
        ```

        Alternative syntax

        ```python
        import scipy.stats as stats

        # The degree of freedom is assumed 2
        # With a p-value of 0.05, the confidence level is 1.00-0.05 = 0.95.
        critical_value = stats.chi2.ppf(q = 0.95, df = 2)

        # Run the chi square test with stats.chisquare()
        stats.chisquare(df['observed'], df['expected'])
        ```

    * Post hoc test when explanatory variable has >2 levels
        
        Bonferroni Adjusted p-value = $\frac{0.05}{\#\ comparisons}$ <br>
        Run $\chi^2$ test of independence for each paired comparison

        <img src="resources/chi_suqare_post_hoc.png" width=400>

        ```python
        recode2 = {1: 1, 2.5: 2.5}
        sub2['COMP1v2']= sub2['USFREQMO'].map(recode2)

        # contingency table of observed counts
        ct2=pandas.crosstab(sub2['TAB12MDX'], sub2['COMP1v2'])
        print (ct2)

        # column percentages
        colsum=ct2.sum(axis=0)
        colpct=ct2/colsum
        print(colpct)

        print ('chi-square value, p value, expected counts')
        cs2= scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(ct2)
        print (cs2)

        recode3 = {1: 1, 6: 6}
        sub2['COMP1v6']= sub2['USFREQMO'].map(recode3)

        # contingency table of observed counts
        ct3=pandas.crosstab(sub2['TAB12MDX'], sub2['COMP1v6'])
        print (ct3)

        # column percentages
        colsum=ct3.sum(axis=0)
        colpct=ct3/colsum
        print(colpct)

        print ('chi-square value, p value, expected counts')
        cs3= scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(ct3)
        print (cs3)
        ```

### 2.4. Pearson Correlation

Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.

Correlation ignores any other type of relationship no matter how strong.

* $r$: Pearson correlation coefficient
* $r^2$: R Squared or Coefficient of Determination

    The fraction of the variability of 1 variable that can be predicted by the other. Aka., if we know x, we can predict $r^2$ of the variability we will see in y.

* Code

    Pearson correlation coefficient

    ```python
    import pandas
    import numpy
    import seaborn
    import scipy
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Print r and the corresponding p-value
    print ('association between urbanrate and internetuserate')
    print (scipy.stats.pearsonr(data_clean['urbanrate'], data_clean['internetuserate']))

    print ('association between incomeperperson and internetuserate')
    print (scipy.stats.pearsonr(data_clean['incomeperperson'], data_clean['internetuserate']))
    ```

    Visualize

    ```python
    scat1 = seaborn.regplot(x="urbanrate", y="internetuserate", fit_reg=True, data=data)
    plt.xlabel('Urban Rate')
    plt.ylabel('Internet Use Rate')
    plt.title('Scatterplot for the Association Between Urban Rate and Internet Use Rate')

    scat2 = seaborn.regplot(x="incomeperperson", y="internetuserate", fit_reg=True, data=data)
    plt.xlabel('Income per Person')
    plt.ylabel('Internet Use Rate')
    plt.title('Scatterplot for the Association Between Income per Person and Internet Use Rate')
    ```
### 2.5. Moderation

Moderating variable (or moderator) is a third variable that affects the direction and or strength of the relation between the explanatory and response variable.

* Testing moderation in the context of ANOVA

    Is our explanatory variable associated with our response variable, for each population subgroup or each level of our third variable?

    ```python
    sub2=data[(data['Exercise']=='Cardio')]
    sub3=data[(data['Exercise']=='Weights')]

    print ('association between diet and weight loss for those using Cardio exercise')
    model2 = smf.ols(formula='WeightLoss ~ C(Diet)', data=sub2).fit()
    print (model2.summary())

    print ('association between diet and weight loss for those using Weights exercise')
    model3 = smf.ols(formula='WeightLoss ~ C(Diet)', data=sub3).fit()
    print (model3.summary())

    print ("means for WeightLoss by Diet A vs. B  for CARDIO")
    m3= sub2.groupby('Diet').mean()
    print (m3)
    print ("Means for WeightLoss by Diet A vs. B for WEIGHTS")
    m4 = sub3.groupby('Diet').mean()
    print (m4)
    ```

* Testing moderation in the context of Chi Square

    Is explanatory variable related to response variable, for each level of our third variable?

    ```python
    sub3=sub2[(sub2['MAJORDEPLIFE']== 0)]
    sub4=sub2[(sub2['MAJORDEPLIFE']== 1)]

    print ('association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence for those W/O deperession')
    # contingency table of observed counts
    ct2=pandas.crosstab(sub3['TAB12MDX'], sub3['USQUAN'])
    print (ct2)

    # column percentages
    colsum=ct1.sum(axis=0)
    colpct=ct1/colsum
    print(colpct)

    # chi-square
    print ('chi-square value, p value, expected counts')
    cs2= scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(ct2)
    print (cs2)

    print ('association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence for those WITH depression')
    # contingency table of observed counts
    ct3=pandas.crosstab(sub4['TAB12MDX'], sub4['USQUAN'])
    print (ct3)

    # column percentages
    colsum=ct1.sum(axis=0)
    colpct=ct1/colsum
    print(colpct)

    # chi-square
    print ('chi-square value, p value, expected counts')
    cs3= scipy.stats.chi2_contingency(ct3)
    print (cs3)

    # Visualize
    seaborn.factorplot(x="USQUAN", y="TAB12MDX", data=sub4, kind="point", ci=None)
    plt.xlabel('number of cigarettes smoked per day')
    plt.ylabel('Proportion Nicotine Dependent')
    plt.title('association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence for those WITH depression')

    seaborn.factorplot(x="USQUAN", y="TAB12MDX", data=sub3, kind="point", ci=None)
    plt.xlabel('number of cigarettes smoked per day')
    plt.ylabel('Proportion Nicotine Dependent')
    plt.title('association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence for those WITHOUT depression')
    ```

* Testing moderation in the context of correlation

    ```python
    sub1=data_clean[(data_clean['incomegrp']== 1)]
    sub2=data_clean[(data_clean['incomegrp']== 2)]

    print('association between urbanrate and internetuserate for LOW income countries')
    print(scipy.stats.pearsonr(sub1['urbanrate'], sub1['internetuserate']))
    print()
    print('association between urbanrate and internetuserate for MIDDLE income countries')
    print(scipy.stats.pearsonr(sub2['urbanrate'], sub2['internetuserate']))

    scat1 = seaborn.regplot(x="urbanrate", y="internetuserate", data=sub1)
    plt.xlabel('Urban Rate')
    plt.ylabel('Internet Use Rate')
    plt.title('Scatterplot for the Association Between Urban Rate and Internet Use Rate for LOW income countries')
    print(scat1)
    scat2 = seaborn.regplot(x="urbanrate", y="internetuserate", fit_reg=False, data=sub2)
    plt.xlabel('Urban Rate')
    plt.ylabel('Internet Use Rate')
    plt.title('Scatterplot for the Association Between Urban Rate and Internet Use Rate for MIDDLE income countries')
    print(scat2)
    ```

## 3. The Student's t-test

### 3.1. One Sample T-Test

Compare sample mean to the population mean

* Assumptions

  * Data is normally distributed
  * Data is independent
  * Data is randomly sampled

* Code

    ```python
    import scipy.stats as stats
    stats.ttest_1samp(sample, population.mean())
    ```

### 3.2. Independent T-Test

Compare the means of 2 independent populations, i.e., how likely that two samples represent the same underlying population

* Assumptions

    * Data is normally distributed
    * Data is independent
    * Data is homogenous (The standard deviations are roughly equal)

* Code

    ```python
    import scipy.stats as stats

    # Note: Setting equal_var=False performs Welch's t-test which does 
    # not assume equal population variance
    stats.ttest_ind(population1, population2, equal_var=False)
    ```
